      <p>I’m a 22-year-old aspiring programmer who started coding in mid-2023. Drawn to Python for its vast community and beginner-friendly nature, I quickly made it my primary language. Before that, I explored HTML and CSS with an interest in web development.</p>
      <p>I love programming so much that I once coded for 16 hours straight, completely absorbed and forgetting to eat or drink. Moments like these fuel my passion and commitment to continuous learning, innovation, and growth in my programming career.</p>
