      <p>I’m a 22-year-old aspiring programmer who started coding in mid-2023. Initially, I was interested in web development and explored HTML and CSS, but Python quickly became my primary language. Its large community, simplicity, and flexibility made it the perfect choice for me to dive deeper into programming. I love coding so much that I once spent 16 hours straight working on a project, completely absorbed in the process and forgetting to eat or drink. Moments like these make me appreciate programming even more — it’s not just about writing code but about solving problems, creating something new, and constantly improving my skills. I’m committed to continuous learning and growth because programming isn’t just a skill for me — it’s a passion and a path toward professional development.</p>
